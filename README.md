# Eng_Deu_Translation_RNN
Recurrent Neural Network designed for sequence translation from English to German and vice versa. Implemented with a Gated Recurrent Unit structure featuring an attention mechanism. Trained on a comprehensive dataset. Additional details can be found in the colab notebook.

For demonstration purposes the number of epochs was set to 10 but generally the best results occur when 20+ are used as the loss tends to converge to 0.5 but is only at 0.8 after 10 epochs.

**NOTE:** The dataset is too large include in the repo but the link is provided below.
